Extension information
This is a DATEX II extension model for the publication of quantitative evaluation of traffic management plans.

The model can express results from an evaluation service, for example a predictive evaluation service with short-term traffic prediction and what-if scenario modelling.

Although the model has not been implemented and tested in software in this precise form, it is based on a similar (non-DATEX) model that has been implemented and shown to support integration of systems.
