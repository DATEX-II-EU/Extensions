Extension information
 The Italian motorway companies  have set up a working group in order to develop the architecture and technology choices to ensure the information and safety management in emergency high-impact situations, as these for their characteristics and location in the network must be managed in cooperation between several road operators.
 The aim of the working group was to assess the requirements and propose possible solutions for the management of information and messages on VMS for high-impact situations, through the use of rerouting and other operations to reduce the effects of the traffic disturbing situations.

The first aim of the group has been to provide DATEX based solution to grant correct Information Delivery and VMS management Data Exchange. As a further goal, TMP management has been analysed, starting from FR-ES proposal made to ESG2 which has been reviewed and extended to manage general TMP framework based on Easyway TMP Deployment Guidelines concepts and guidance.
