Extension information
This is an initial draft of a proposed level B extension for a new VMS publication. It allows current information relating to Variable Message Signs which are deployed across the road network to be published without having to be associated with a Situation.

It is intended that the structures used in this proposal are made reusable which will allow them to replace the SignSetting sub-model within the current SituationPublication.

Where enumerations overlap with existing enumerations in the current model a prefix of "VmsExt" has been added to the enumeration name. This prefix would of course be removed if/when this proposal is incorporated into the level A model and replaces the current SignSetting structure.

The full EA Model file and XML Schema which incorporate the proposed new VMS Publication into the Level A model are downloadable below. Also the separate xmi export file just containing the Extension package is made available for download.
